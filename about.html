								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>I am first generation American whose parents immigrated from India.
									I was born and raised in Lake Charles, Louisiana for 18 years then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana to attend the Louisiana State University.
									I have a strong background in business management as my parents own multiple businesses, and I have been working at these businesses since I was 16 years old.
									My hobbies consist of going to the gym, playing golf, and occasionally playing video games.
								</p>
								<h2>Career and Studies</h2>
								<p>At Louisiana State University, I currently major in Information Systems and Decision Sciences and minor in Data Analytics.
									I am currently looking for a role in data analytics.
									Along with that role, I am going to obtain my masters in data science as that is my end goal.
									Additionally, I have completed and am working on a few projects that are presented in the projects tab.
									These projects portray skills of data analysis, data visualization, and web design.
								</p>
								<h2>Hobbies</h2>
								<p>Going to the gym, playing golf, and playing video games are my three main hobbies.
									I love going to the gym since it helps me to relieve stress.
									Paired with a healthy and balanced diet, the gym helps me stay active and in shape.
									Golf recently became a hobby for me.
									Golf increases my motor skills and keeps me socially active by going to play a round with friends.
									Lastly, video games have been apart of my whole life.
									Recently, I have only played occasionally; nonetheless, the love for video games is still there.
